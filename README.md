## Problem
An english font at 14px as a regular size is not legible enough in non-english languages.

## Context
General practice across apps has been to keep 14px as regular font size. This works best in case of app in English language only. A 14px non-english text looks similar to 12px or 13px english text.

## Goal
Identify an optimal regular font size for english and non-english language.
